### A brief explanation of interesting and useful cost management features 
#### Azure
**1. Cost Analysis:** Azure provides a detailed cost analysis tool that allows you to view and analyze your spending. You can filter costs by resource, service, or tag, and visualize trends over time with charts and graphs. This helps you understand where your money is going and identify any anomalies or unexpected charges.

**2. Budgets:** You can set up budgets to monitor your spending against predefined limits. Azure allows you to set budgets for specific resource groups, services, or the entire subscription. You can also configure alerts to notify you when you're approaching or exceeding your budget, helping you stay within your financial constraints

**3. Cost Alerts:** Azure enables you to set up cost alerts based on your budget or spending thresholds. These alerts can be configured to notify you via email or other channels when spending exceeds certain limits, allowing you to take corrective actions promptly.
