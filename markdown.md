### A brief explanation of interesting and useful cost management features 
#### -Azure-
**1. Cost analysis:** Azure provides a very detailed cost analysis tool that allows one to view and analyze their spending. The analysis can be filtered which makes it helpful when looking for something specific. It also helps visualize trends over time with charts and graphs and helps identify anomalies and unexpected charges. 

**2. Budgets:** Budgeting is a difficult thing to do at an organizational level. Being able to predefine budgeting limits can help organizations stay within their financial constraints.
What is very useful about this tool is that one can configure alerts/notifications when the budget is being approached or exceeded. 

**3. Cost alerts:** This is also related to the budget alerts mentioned previously. Additionally, these alerts can be configured to notify someone through email and other channels. This will allow for prompt corrective action on the part of the user. 

#### -GCP-
**1. Cost breakdown and reports:** GCP gives thorough cost breakdowns and reports, which can help understand where the money is going. It can be viewed through many filters such as service, project, or resource and can analyze spending patterns to point out opportunities for savings. 

**2. Recommendation tool:** This tool is really helpful to get personalized recommendations for optimizing resource usage. It helps identify which services/instances are driving costs and helps avoid over-provisioning to reduce costs.
